On Linux, it'll find SDL2 automatically. If SDL2 in your distro is too
outdated, build and install it locally using cmake, and use this:
	cmake -DSDL2_DIR=/usr/local/lib/cmake/SDL2 build
On Windows, download the development libs, copy extlib/sdl2-config.cmake into
that directory, and specify it as SDL2_DIR.
